** Need to make sure everybody has the "Optimize `using` Directives" commit option enabled

== Build Error #2

NOTE: This was a repeat of an issue encountered during link:https://github.com/brandoncimino/ludum-dare-47#problems-that-arose-during-the-build-process[ludum-dare-47]. It arose again because I didn't properly update the dependencies in the `unity-template` project.
